# Are You the Author?

**A self-reflection survey on human behaviour, free will, and the forces that shape our choices.**

This is a command-line Python project that invites users to reflect on their views around free will and determinism. The programme asks 10 curated questions, compares user responses to predefined philosophical profiles, and provides tailored feedback. It also includes age-group-based insights and a thought-provoking reflection at the end.

## Features

* ðŸ§  Belief-matching survey based on 10 key philosophical questions.
* ðŸ“Š Optional age group insights showing broader trends (illustrative data).
* ðŸ§­ Random reflection quotes inspired by thinkers like Sapolsky and Nietzsche.
* ðŸ’¡ Beginner-friendly Python code with clear structure and comments.

---

## How It Works

1. User is asked to begin the survey.
2. After age input, the survey presents 10 questions (Likert scale format).
3. User responses are compared with reference profiles (in `reference_profiles.txt`).
4. Closest belief profile is displayed along with a similarity percentage.
5. Age group insights are shown (based on mock data in `age_attitudes.txt`).
6. Ends with a reflection prompt.

## Files

* `Are you the Author?.py` â€“ The main Python script.
* `reference_profiles.txt` â€“ Defines belief profiles and their patterns.
* `age_attitudes.txt` â€“ Age-group insights (NOTE: **data is partially fictional**).

---

## Important Note on Age Data

The data in `age_attitudes.txt` is **illustrative only**:

* Some numbers are loosely based on public opinion trends.
* Others are **entirely fictional** and meant to encourage reflection.
* This is **not a scientific tool** but a philosophical exercise.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* No external libraries required.
